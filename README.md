# PolyReboot
## Python script to send a reboot command to Poly Studio devices

An ongoing issue with Studio Devices makes the camera stop sending image when it has been running for too long, until the device is restarted. 

This script is a starting point for a better way of automating reboot devices.

For best practices, device IP addresses or hostnames should be in an external file and read at runtime.
Username and password should also be an external variable.

Feel free to fork/clone the project and apply your modifications.
